JRelease does not work in Maven multimodule project: it creates many repo's (one for each module).

Releasing:
- mvnw clean deploy jreleaser:full-release -DaltDeploymentRepository=local::file:./target/staging-deploy
  requires certificates in ~/.jreleaser/config.toml
- goto https://oss.sonatype.org
- find the latest repo, check the contents, close and release manually
- drop the other repos
